A comparative implementation of NFT minting functionality across three blockchain protocols: Bitcoin (Ordinals), Ethereum (ERC-721), and Solana (Metaplex). This project demonstrates the technical differences, development complexity, and user experience of creating digital collectibles on each platform while maintaining consistent metadata and functionality.
Developed as part of a bachelor's thesis research at the University of Latvia.
